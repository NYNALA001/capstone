	The Centre for Artificial Intelligence Research (CAIR) is a South
	African distributed Centre of Excellence that conducts foundational,
	directed and applied research into various aspects of Artificial
	Intelligence. CAIR has nodes at five South African universities: the
	University of Cape Town, University of KwaZulu-Natal, North-West
	University, University of Pretoria and Stellenbosch University, and is
	coordinated and managed by the Meraka Institute at the Council for
	Scientific and Industrial Research. CAIR was founded by Prof. Tommie
	Meyer and Dr. Deshen Moodley in November 2011 as a joint research
	centre between the University of KwaZulu-Natal and the Council for
	Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). In 2015 CAIR expanded to
	four other South African universities with the CSIR playing a
	coordinating role. CAIR is primarily funded by the Department of
	Science and Technology (DST), as part of the implementation of South
	<br>
	<br> Africa's ICT Research, Development and Innovation (RDI) Roadmap.
	CAIR's mandate is to strengthen RDI capacity at participating nodes to
	guide South Africa to a state of digital advantage in Artificial
	Intelligence that will strengthen economic competitiveness and enable
	an enhanced quality of life for all South Africans. The CSIR Meraka
	Institute, as an implementing body of the RDI, established CAIR as a
	National Centre of Excellence in Artificial Intelligence Research.
